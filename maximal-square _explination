1 <= nums.length <= 105
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
1 <= k <= nums.length
Constraints:
 
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7]

Return the max sliding window.
You are given an array of integers nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. 
You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

solution:

Certainly! This code is aimed at solving the problem of finding the size of the largest square of '1's in a binary matrix using dynamic programming. Let's break down the code:

maximalSquare Function:
Arguments:

matrix: A 2D array representing the binary matrix.
matrixSize: Number of rows in the matrix.
matrixColSize: Pointer to an array storing the number of columns in each row of the matrix.
Logic:

It initializes m as the number of rows and n as the number of columns in the matrix.
Declares a 2D array dp to store the size of the square ending at position (i, j) in the input matrix.
Initializes ans to store the maximum size of the square found.
Iterates through each cell of the input matrix:
If it's in the first row or column and contains a '1', sets the corresponding cell in the dp matrix to 1 because it forms a square of size 1.
For other cells:
If the current cell in the input matrix contains a '1', calculates the size of the square ending at the current cell by taking the minimum of the sizes of the squares formed by the adjacent cells (up, left, and diagonal-up-left). It adds 1 to this minimum size and stores it in the dp matrix.
If the current cell contains '0', sets the square size to 0.
Updates ans to store the maximum square size encountered so far.
Return:

Returns the area of the largest square found (ans * ans).
Macro Definitions:
Two macros max and min are defined for finding the maximum and minimum of two values respectively using the ternary operator.
Overall, this code implements a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem of finding the largest square of '1's in a binary matrix by using a 2D array dp to store the sizes of squares and efficiently calculating the maximum square size encountered.
